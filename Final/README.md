Heyo, this is my README.md for my final project.  My final project is the good 'ol classic game snake.  It has a bit of a twist to it though.  This project was actually really difficult for me but overall was fun to do.  Over this past semester I believe that I have learned a lot from this class, and I eagerly await the opportunity to learn more.  The part in this assignment where I struggled most has probably got to be the sounds.  I'm pretty sure I tried for a solid hour to get the sounds to actually work but to no avail.  There video that we have to do for this assignment was also kind of difficult because i've never uploaded a video to youtube before.
