# Lane Healy's MART191 Course Repo

This is a git repo for all of my work during the spring 2017

https://lanehealy.github.io/Lane-s-repository/HWv2-03/empty-example/

I did what i set out to do, which was to create a vampire for this assignment.
The only problems I have faced was at the end when I couldn't get my sketch to appear properly online.
